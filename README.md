# 💰 Salary Prediction Web App

An interactive **Machine Learning web application** built using **Streamlit** that predicts salary based on user input features.  
The application uses a trained **Regression model** to estimate salary in real-time with a simple and user-friendly interface.

This project demonstrates practical implementation of:
- Data preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model training
- Model serialization
- Web app integration with Machine Learning

---

## 🚀 Features
- Interactive and clean Streamlit UI
- Real-time salary prediction
- Trained Machine Learning regression model
- Model deployed locally using Streamlit
- Easy-to-use input system

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow
1. Data collection and preprocessing
2. Feature selection and encoding
3. Model training using regression algorithm
4. Model saving using Pickle
5. Deployment using Streamlit
